<p>Classifying cells into meaningful celltypes (or cell states) is a time consuming, but extremely important, part of a spatial analysis.</p>
<p>It may involve pulling together multiple lines of evidence to assign celltype labels to cluster labels. Some approaches outlined below:</p>
<div id="cluster-markers" class="section level2" number="12.1">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Cluster Markers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cluster-markers"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Considering our clusters - lets find some more meaningful labels than 1-10! What genes are expresses specifically in each of these clusters?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb92"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/DimPlot.html">DimPlot</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">so</span>, group.by<span class="op">=</span><span class="st">'seurat_clusters'</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="IntroSpatialTranscriptomics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-74-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>The ‘FindAllMarkers’ function runs a differential expression test to see what genes are expressed differently between each celltype and the rest of the experiment. The ‘only.pos’ parameter is useful to report only genes enriched (not absent) in each cluster.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb93"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Need to join the layers back again for this.</span></span>

<p>Now we have a list of ‘marker’ genes. They’re not markers in the sense of canonical celltype markers - they’re just defined from the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at those p-values! They’re extremely significant because each cell is treated as a replicate (and samples are ignored).</li>
<li>We can filter on fold-change (avg_log2FC) of expression to emphasise more interesting larger change (as even very small difference can be significant, but not useful for determining cell types).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">human protein atlas</a> is a useful site to look up the single cell RNA expression of a given gene; e.g. <a href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/search/CD37">CD37</a></p>

<p>You can get some more information form these marker lists by dropping them into a tool like <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/enrich">enrichr</a> and considering cell type enrichment.
NB: enrichR also has a R package, and could be done programatically</p>

<p>There are a number of tools that classify cells into types on the basis of similarity with a reference dataset. SingleR is one such tool.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb98"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/LTLA/SingleR">SingleR</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>But first we need to acquire a reference dataset.</p>
<p>A typical reference would be from a public single cell datasets from a matched celltype with a trusted annotation. Look for a relevant paper which has provided their GEO accession number or similar. Note that not every study remembers to publish their annotations alongside their raw data, but the authors might be willing to supply you with a processed dataset if you ask.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are some databases of single cell datasets - see <a href="https://data.humancellatlas.org/">Human Cell Atlas</a> or <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/datasets">CELLxGENE datasets</a>. These databases also let you browse the data online - which is an excellent resource for the design or cell annotation stages; you can look up gene expression in a particular celltype to see if it matches what you are seeing.</p>
<p>The tabula sapiens project (<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4896">paper</a>) as built a single cell atlas from a good number of human tissues. Its data is browse-able and hosted in the <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/e5f58829-1a66-40b5-a624-9046778e74f5">cellXgene tabular sapiens collection</a></p>
<p>These are colon tissue samples, and there is a large intestine set listed (which includes colon samples). Conveniently, we can browse the data online to check if it will be suitable: via a <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/7357cee7-9f7f-4ab0-8cec-90de8f047e38.cxg/">cellXgene interface</a></p>
<p>Broad cell class looks pretty good. There’s colon included. Some individual level effect in the UMAP (stem cells limited to 1-2 samples). It’ll work, and there’s an easy link to download the data.</p>
<p>The reference dataset has been pre-downloaded onto the VMs</p>

<p>Its a .h5ad file, common from pythonic analyses. Luckily we can use the schard package to read it into R directly. But not to a seurat object.</p>

<p>Instead it builds a SingleCellExperiment object - a data format central to bioconductor packages (this is fine, SingleR is from bioconductor too!). SCE objects work quite similarly to seurat objects, but have different notation - e.g. <em>colData</em> and <em>rowData</em> access the cell and gene information respectively.</p>

</h2>
<p>Note that there are many more tools and approaches for determining celltypes. Especially in the reference based tool space singleR is just one option; See <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-025-06044-0">review</a></p>
<p>It may be worthwhile to seek a method that uses image and positional data in conjunction with transcriptome - it is an active area of research, but for now, singleR was good enough. When seeking such methods, be aware that some methods developed for spot-based technologies (Visium), may not necessarily work or scale to in-situ single cell technologies.</p>
<p>For today, lets apply some celltype labels.</p>

<p>The ‘singleR2’ set is very, very detailed! Too much for plotting on the tissue. The Macrophage subtypes were important in the paper, but we didn’t see a simple macrophage cluster in our clusters. We can do a very quick heatmap to look at how the two classifications compare (this can work better when there are too many celltypes to display nicely with colours). NB: This plot doesn’t view well at small sizes - zoom in to see all the labels.</p>
