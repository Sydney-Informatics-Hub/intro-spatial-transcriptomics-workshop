Explain e.g. cosmx in detail, refer to similarities in e.g. xenium Load data into object Brief explanation of different data structures Sample annotation: Applying sample names to individual slides. Mention difficulty of multiple samples per slide (can we recommend some approach?) ===== 6.1 The raw data For a cosmx SMI slide (like this experiment). Flat files : Most of what we need to do processing. Typically a directory of flat files is read in as a whole, and we don’t need to worry too much. But note there are no images in here. SLIDE-polygons.csv.gz : Cell borders SLIDE_exprMat_file.csv.gz : Counts of genes per cell (Counts matrix) SLIDE_fov_positions_file.csv.gz : Location of FOVs on slide SLIDE_metadata_file.csv.gz : Cell level QC metadata SLIDE_tx_file.csv.gz : Location of individual transcripts. Raw files : Giant ugly directory with lots of files including microscopy images. RawFiles/SLIDE/RUN_CODE/CellStatsDir/Morphology2D : Location of images https://github.com/Nanostring-Biostats/CosMxDACustomModules/blob/main/Export/CosMxDAExportSetup.docx For a Xenium slide there is just the one typical output directory; they discuss the formats in the section on data archiving, but again, software tools take the directory as a whole.
