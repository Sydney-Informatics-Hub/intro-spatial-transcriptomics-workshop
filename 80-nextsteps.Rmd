# Next steps



## The scope of what was done with this data:

Wrap up (10)
We have preprocessed some data, now run tests/do analysis 




Summarise what Garrido-Trigo et al _actually_ did with this dataset in their paper;

* Macrophage proximity tests
* Integration with single cell data 
* integration with other spatial omics
* ...




## Other techniques.


**Segmentation**

Good cell segmentation from images underpins downstream analysis. Different platforms offer inbuilt segmentation methods, and often require tweaking from the default with different tissues, antibodies or runs. 

* On-machine segmentation: e.g. Xenium/Cosmx
* Directly from images using specialised microscopy methods for segmentation.

**Sample annotation**

It's typical to have multiple samples on a single slide. We need to label each cell with its ID.

* Define samples by their centroid x-y coordinates 
* THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY A little 'cicle' here interactive tool. 


**Visualisation**

* Napari
* CellXGene (single cells)
* iSEE (single cell)
* Xenium explorer (Xenium only)
* Atomx (cosmx only)


**Niche analysis**

Cell neighbour niche analysis is a major avenue of in situ spatial analysise. E.g. Defining 


* Seuruat findNiches()
* OSCA neighbourhood analyses: https://lmweber.org/OSTA/pages/img-neighborhood-analysis.html
* hoodscanR : https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/hoodscanR/inst/doc/Quick_start.html



**'Spatial' pattern tests and cell free analyses**

* Spatial tests, adapted form geospatial methods:  https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/
* Co-localisation and differntial co-localisation: https://lmweber.org/OSTA/pages/mult-diff-spatial-patterns.html
* Molecule level data object (not a SingleCellExperiment): https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MoleculeExperiment.html


**Multiomics**

* https://lmweber.org/OSTA/pages/crs-spatial-registration.html
* https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette (single cell)
