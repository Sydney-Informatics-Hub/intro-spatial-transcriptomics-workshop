# Input Data{#data}


What does the data look like when you get it? Examine raw data.

* Explain e.g. cosmx in detail, refer to similarities in e.g. xenium
* Load data into object
* Brief explanation of different data structures 
* Sample annotation: Applying sample names to individual slides. Mention difficulty of multiple samples per slide (can we recommend some approach?)
