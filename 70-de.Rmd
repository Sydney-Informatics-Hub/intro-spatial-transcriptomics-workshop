NB: I'll probably update that material to include some spatial plots.

## Spatially informed differntial expression


This particular tests is quite simple - and doesn't use spatial information. However, if we define some groups in a spatial way, we can use the same approach to test spatial hypotheses;

e.g. Given some cancer samples, identify cancer and stroma microenviromnemt. (NB: How to do that? Potentially with the 'BuildNicheAssay' functionality see [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_spatial_vignette_2))

* Expression in T cells within tumour regions vs normal tissue: 
   + (T cells within tumour niche) - (T cells in stromal niche)
* Cancer cell expression in immune hot vs cold region
   + (Cancer cells near T-cells) - (Cancer cells not near T-cells)
