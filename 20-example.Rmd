# Example Experiment {#exampleexperiment}

## Background

This workshop will use data from paper *Macrophage and neutrophil heterogeneity
at single-cell spatial resolution in human inflammatory bowel disease*
(Garrido-Trigo et al. 2023)[^1].

[^1]: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40156-6

**Hypothesis: There is a difference in immune cell localisation between healthy
donors vs donors with active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**

The authors have made their raw and annotated data available (and their
[code](https://github.com/HelenaLC/CosMx-SMI-IBD)). There is also a browsable
interface here: https://servidor2-ciberehd.upc.es/external/garrido/app/.

## The samples and study design

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC).

The study included 9 CosMx slides of colonic biopsies, from a total of 9 donors:

| Cohorts            | Abbreviated | Number of samples |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Healthy controls   | HC          | 3                 |
| Ulcerative colitis | UC          | 3                 |
| Chron's disease    | DC          | 3                 |

In the original paper, the CosMX SMI cells were annotated via label transfer from
the scRNA data. Here, we will do some basic processing of those 9 samples - QC,
clustering and visualisation.
